     "addRoleFail": "Hey there! I was trying to assign you your branch and year role but failed, probably because I know too less about you.\nYou can get your role by sending an easy command in the bot-commands channel. The command is !assign YYBB where YYBB is the initial four characters of your roll number. For example, if you're 20CS01001 you can send !assign 20CS . Please remember that 20cs/20Cs/20cS will all be invalid. I'm a little busy right now will open the bot-commands channel after 10-15 minutes, please try ONLY when it is open, do not reply here.",
